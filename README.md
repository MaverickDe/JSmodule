## Description
``` bash
 
Creating javascripts built  methods and functions in python
 
 
This is an open source project , it which tries shorten python code syntax and implement javascript syntax
 
The project is divided into modules . Ech modules for a specific functions
 
 
```
Need for the project
```
Python is a robust programming language with batteries included, therefore , to perform some regular task , you need to import different modules every subsequent time you work on a project  . If you are coming for the javascript environment, yo will understand perfectly what i am saying
 
For example in javascript, setting a setTimeout function is pretty straight forward, you don't need to import any module not to talk of two modules unlike python
 
Coming from the javascript , mastering all this modules in python is a quite a task , so putting together the functionality inside functions which has similar name with the functions in javascript will help javascript developers navigate the python environment easily
 
```
 
This is an open source project , hence the code can be reviewed , changed and if the change is worth it, it will be implemented
 
```
 
 
``` To add a function
```
If no directory that has a related function exist in the project, you can write you code in a new directory
and import it to the js module folder
 
 
Note: let the name of your  directory ends with module, not compulsory , but a pattern to implement good folder structure
 
 
```
To Modify a code
```
 
State the reason for modification and the benefit incurred after modification
 
```
